                            <p>The primary intention of the Hijab is to protect women from evil eyes. Allah says: “O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused.”</p>
                            <h3>Is abaya mentioned in the Quran?</h3>
                            <p>The rationale for the abaya is often attributed to the Quranic quote: "O Prophet, tell your wives and daughters, and the believing women, to cover themselves with a loose garment. They will thus be recognised and no harm will come to them" (Qur'an 33:59, translated by Ahmed Ali).</p>
